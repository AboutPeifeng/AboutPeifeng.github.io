# Personal Homepage

This repository hosts my **personal academic homepage**, built with **GitHub Pages**.

The website serves as a centralized place to present my **research profile**, **publications**, **projects**, and a growing **knowledge base** (technical notes), along with selected personal reflections.

**Live site**: https://aboutpeifeng.github.io

## 💡 Motivation

As research progresses, information often becomes scattered across papers, repositories, notes, and slides.  
This homepage is designed to:

- Provide a **clear academic profile** for collaborators and readers
- Maintain a **structured record** of research outputs and projects
- Accumulate **reusable technical notes** (Git, Linux, and so on)
- Serve as a **long-term, low-maintenance** personal knowledge hub
